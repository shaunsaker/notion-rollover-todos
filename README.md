# Notion Rollover TODOs

# What is it?

A script that generates a new Notion page every day based on the previous day’s template. It also removes completed TODOs.

# Why?

I want to keep track of completed TODOs over time. I might also want to see some stats in the future.

# TODOs

- [ ] Create local script using the Notion API
- [ ] Deploy script to the cloud (try supabase)
- [ ] Open source it so that other’s can use it
