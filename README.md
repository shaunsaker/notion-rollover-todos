# Notion Rollover TODOs

# What is it?

A script that archives your completed TODOs from a Notion database.

# Why?

I want to keep track of completed TODOs over time. I might also want to see some stats in the future.

# TODOs

- [x] Create local script using the Notion API
- [ ] Deploy script to the cloud (try supabase)
- [ ] Open source it so that otherâ€™s can use it
